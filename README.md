# Semantic Change Analysis of Colonial Terminology in Dutch Newspapers (1860-1960)

This repository contains code and data to analyse the semantic evolution of colonial terminology in a dataset of Dutch newspapers using Word2Vec embeddings and POS analysis. We examine semantic change in colonial terminology across two major Dutch newspapers:
- **Algemeen Handelsblad** (liberal perspective, 1860-1960)
- **De Telegraaf** (conservative to far-right, 1893-1960)

The study spans three time periods: 1860-1899, 1900-1939, and 1940-1960, focusing on how colonial terminology evolved across different ideological contexts and historical events.

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

For copyright reasons, we cannot release the full dataset. Therefore, in the folder `data`, we provide the article IDs that we used for training the models. 

- **`multithreaded_delpher.py`**: Scrapes newspaper articles from the Delpher digital archive using their API with multithreading for efficient data collection for the 1880-1960 period. The 1860-1879 data can be directly downloaded from Delpher: https://www.delpher.nl/over-delpher/delpher-open-krantenarchief/download-teksten-kranten-1618-1879#b1741.
  
- **`data_cleaning.py`** to preprocess raw text data by:
  - Removing punctuation, symbols, and numerical characters
  - Filtering words shorter than 3 characters
  - Removing function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) and punctuation.
  
  If your data is in English, you can directly use the model training configurations in the config.yaml setting the preprocessing skip to False (see model_training).

### Embeddings Analysis

- **`model_training`** to train Word2Vec models for each newspaper and time period. The code is adapted from `https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DiachronicEmb-BigHistData/tree/main`.
  To train your data, create a folder in the tests folder (e.g., test_data) with the raw texts divided per period in a txt format with around 500 characters per line. 
  
- **`handelsblad_change.py`** & **`telegraaf_change.py`** to perform embeddings-based analysis:
  - Cosine similarity analysis
  - Nearest neighbours analysis
  - Classification of change patterns (divergence, stability, parallel change)

### Connotation Analysis

- **`pos_tagging.py`**:
  - Assigning POS tags to all words using spaCy Dutch model (nl_core_news_sm)
    
- **`connotation_analysis.ipynb`**:
  - Extracting the most frequent adjective modifiers for each noun keyword
  - Extracting the most frequent nouns for each adjective keyword
